# Population-Map

folium makes it easy to visualize data thatâ€™s been manipulated in Python on an interactive leaflet map. It enables both the binding of data to a map for choropleth visualizations as well as passing rich vector/raster/HTML visualizations as markers on the map.

The library has a number of built-in tilesets from OpenStreetMap, Mapbox, and Stamen, and supports custom tilesets with Mapbox or Cloudmade API keys. folium supports both Image, Video, GeoJSON and TopoJSON overlays.


In this program, by the help of folium I created a world map which gives a brief history of world population on the basis of the country's population in the year 2005. The data is old but good for practice puropse. 


The code also marks the Volcanoes in the United States of America with the elevations.
